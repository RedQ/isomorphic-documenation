# Spark JWT Implementation

### Server Side

In this section we will show you how to implement JSON Web Token (JWT) using Spark java framework.

To implement the framework you have to download [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) . Here implementation is done by Eclipse.

First, Open the `isomorphic-servers` folder in your favorite editor. where you will find the below folder structure



You can see we have provided and extra servers/spark folder where we have implemented our ***Spark JWT Authentication***.

### Docker Implementation

You can directly run it on docker. For that go to `isomorphic-servers/spark` location in terminal and write following codes

```
docker build -t isoserver .
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 isoserver
```

### IDE Implementations


To Run the Server follow the below steps,

i) Open your IdE(Here Eclipse. Go to `File->Open Projects File From File Systems` and select `isomorphic-servers/spark` location.

ii) In your editor you will see the project

iii) At last run the application

ok, now our server is running successfully at 9000 port

*** Lets see what's inside the server folder & what's happening there ***

From the above snap you can see that theres a `src/main/javafolder` where all the Java classes are kept.

The Application class holds all the routes

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        enableDebugScreen();
        port(9000);
        before("/api/secret/*", Filters.checkAuthentication);

        get(Path.Web.INTRO, (request, response) -> {
            return "Isomorphic Spark Jwt Implementation";
        });
        // set up login routes
        post(Path.Web.LOGIN, Users.serveLoginPage);
        // set up routes
        post(Path.Api.TEST, Api.demoTest);

        // set up blank routes
        get("*", ViewUtil.notFound);

        // set up after-filters (called after each get/post)
        after("*", Filters.addHeaders);
    }
```

A basic routing api app is given in Api class(`java/api/api.java`)

```java
public static Route demoTest = (Request request, Response response) -> {
        Map<String, String> model = new HashMap<>();
        model.put("message", "succcesful");
        return ViewUtil.testResponse(request, response, model);

    };
```

The User `(java/User)`, `JWTToken(java/util/JWTToken)` and `Filter(java/util/Filter)` classes are used for authorizing and generating data

The dependencies are kept in pom.xml

For more Spark integration see Spark [documentation](http://sparkjava.com/documentation) and [tutorials](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/)

### Client Side

For the client part if you are already familiar with our Isomorphic codebase than all you have to do is to check the below file,

```
isomorphic-servers/src/helpers/jwtAuthentication.js file,
```

where you can find the necessary client side coding,

you can also check the,

```
isomorphic-servers/src/redux
```

where we have done the reducer & saga related code for the jwt authentication.

If you are not familiar with the Isomorphic codebase than we suggest you to check our previous section of this documentation.
