# Getting Started

## Quick Tips

### 1. Use Boilerplate
If you are working on the demo that is Isomorphic.zip, Please try to code on the CustomApp folder. So that on the future updates you can replace your component and container and redux folders and it will not mess up with your work.

### 2. Basic JWT Auth
If you want to get stated JWT Auth, just go to the Isomorphic-servers.zip. We have implemented the basic jwt auth with 3 server side implementation.

### 3. Firebase Authentication and Auth0 Authentication
Check the Documentation in the section Components/Authentication/

If you want to start working on a blank page just try to use the Isomorphic boilerplate. You will have the chance to start from the scratch.


## Styling

We have used styled component in our Isomorphic. Credit goes to the libraries like [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and [styled-theme](https://github.com/diegohaz/styled-theme).
