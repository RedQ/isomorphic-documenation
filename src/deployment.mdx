# Deployment

`yarn buid` or `npm run build` creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.

For deploying your site in firebase visit [Firebase Deployment page](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/test-preview-deploy)
