# Technology We Use

## Monorepo

The	idea	behind a monorepo is to store all	code in a	single version control system (VCS) repository. The	alternative, of course, is to store code split into	many different	VCS	repositories, usually on a service/application/library basis.

Welcome	to the Isomorphic new version Built on a mono-repo structure. Check the below link if you	want to learn	more about yarn workspaces.

1. [Introducing Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/)
2. [Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces)

### Why	we	use	monorep
1. To	store	all	code	in	a	single	version	control	system	(VCS)	repository
2. Easier	collaboration	and	code	sharing
3. Code	refactors	are	easy	/	atomic	commits

***NB:	A	Non	Monorepo	dashboard	version	is	also
available.***
