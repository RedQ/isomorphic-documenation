# Overview

Isomorphic Comes With multiple boilerplate and configurations for different use cases.

1. isomorphic (build with custom CRA)
2. isomorphic-next (SSR supported by next.js)
3. isomorphic-boilerplate ( if Anyone want to use with monorepo and custom CRA )
4. isomorphic-boilerplate-single (If Anyone want to use isomorphic without monorepo)
5. isomorphic-boilerplate-graphql (CRA with GraphQL server and client)
6. isomorphic-servers (example: of different backend integration)

## How we utilize monorepo structure
By using monorepo we simplified `import`

```
import Component from '../../components/Component'
import ContainerComponent from '../../../containers/ContainerComponent'

to

import Component from '@iso/components/Component'
import ContainerComponent from '@iso/containers/ContainerComponent'
```

Reuse `components` , `containers`, `redux`, `assets` , `config` between all our `packages`.By moving them in `shared` folder and setup with monorepo. to import things from there you just prefix with `@iso/folderName`

example:

```
shared/assets ==> @iso/assets

shared/components ==> @iso/components/required_component_path
```

We also move common things like library and ui within `shared/UI and shared/library`

To use them you just need to import things from

```
shared/library ==> @iso/lib

shared/UI ==> @iso/ui
```

## If you don't want to use monorepo in next version

Note: React dashboard version non monorepo is already available in the isomorphic directory check the next section for more informaiton

we didn't provide any without monorepo support for isomorphic-next but you can easily made your own by adding some configurations within `next.config.js` file like:

```
 config.resolve.alias = {
      ...config.resolve.alias,
      // Will make webpack look for these modules in parent directories
      '@iso/assets': require.resolve('shared/assets'),
      '@iso/config': require.resolve('shared/config'),
      '@iso/components': require.resolve('shared/components'),
      '@iso/containers': require.resolve('shared/containers'),
      '@iso/lib': require.resolve('shared/library'),
      '@iso/ui': require.resolve('shared/UI'),
    };
```

Also

**you need to move all the folders from shared within your project folder.**
